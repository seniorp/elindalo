In the twentieth century it was adopted by a group of intellectuals and artists who became known as the Indalino movement.  This group was led by the painter Jésus de Perceval, who has a street in the capital named after him.  They saw their emblem as a little man holding up a rainbow, meant to symbolise a pact between man and the gods to avoid future floods.</p>
<p>A different interpretation has also been made.  It&rsquo;s no more than an archer taking aim at a bird passing overhead.  Take your choice.</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s now the symbol of the province of Almería and something of which the locals are rightly proud.</p>
<p>(If you want one, there&rsquo;s a kiosk outside the Gran Hotel Almería which sells everything from a necklace to a thimble branded with the lovely symbol!)</p>
