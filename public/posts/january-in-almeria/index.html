<p>This attracted a lot of city dwellers out to the sierra at the weekend, with the intention of seeing snow and doing a few selfies!

Unfortunately for many families the road up from Gérgal was closed to traffic all weekend, there was just too much snow and ice for safety.</p>
<p>But for some quick thinkers there was a pleasant diversion through Olula de Castro and Castro de los Filabres.</p>
<p>These mountain villages are normally surrounded by a parched, yellow landscape - not that surprising as they&rsquo;re just a few kilometers from the desert of Tabernas.  However the rain of recent weeks have turned some of the ground green, and with the almond trees in flower the landscape looks amazing at present.</p>
