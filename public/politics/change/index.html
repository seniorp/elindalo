<p>So no, members of the Trio de Colon, stop the noise and accept this necessary modernising revision, the fruit of the unpleasant legacy of 40 years of dictatorship that we must banish from our legislation - and, if possible, from thought - in order to achieve a true democracy free from authoritarian blight.</p>
