    <section class="cf ph3 ph5-l pv3 pv4-l f4 tc-l center measure-wide lh-copy mid-gray"><p>A new government took office recently; King Felipe VI opened the legislature on 3 February 2020. The government is a coalition led by President Pedro Sánchez of the left leaning <em>PSOE</em> (Spanish Socialist Workers Party) and the relative newcomer <em>Podemos</em> (&ldquo;We Can&rdquo;) who are a bit further to the left.</p>
<p>It has taken the loss of a vote of confidence in the former right wing government followed by two general elections to get here.</p>
<p>There are at least four opposition parties in the parliament.  I&rsquo;ll give their nearest British equivalents Ciudadanos (Liberals or New Labour) Popular Party (Conservatives) Vox (National Front) and regional parties (Welsh or Scottish Nationalist in many cases).</p>
<p>These multiple parties on both left and right, coupled with regional nationalists have made it very difficult to form a coherent government and some commentators think this one won&rsquo;t last long.  Having watched the coalition partners forced together over the last couple of years I&rsquo;m less sceptical.</p>
<p>Their first actions were to raise the minimum wage, pensions and public sector wages, and to form a <em>mesa de dialogo</em> to negotiate with the Catalan nationalists.  Recent announcements include outlawing the glorification of the former Franco dictatorship (believe it or not there is still a Francisco Franco Foundation), and looking at the question of Euthanasia.</p>

      We come from Franco&rsquo;s rule and our laws carry many worrying vestiges of those dark times. If we look at the equivalents of comparative law in the more advanced European democracies, we will see that our supposed laws of rebellion and sedition have excessive penalties. In Europe, violence must be present for this last charge; and sentences, although varied, have an average range of 1 to 6 years.
So in 2018, the PSOE supported reform of the crime of rebellion — so that the EU did not continue to censure us and expose our shame, the fruit of a dictatorial regime that we did not really know how to get rid of - now is added, of course, to sedition.
