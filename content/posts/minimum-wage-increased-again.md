The coalition government increased the minimum wage for full time employees to 950 euros with 14 payments per year.  This builds on the 22.3% increase from 735 to 900 euros brought in by the socialist government _en funciones_ last year.

_Podemos_ wanted Sanchez to put it straight up from 735 to 1000 euros last year.  But Sanchez was more cautious, realising that this would cause a backlash from businesses affected by the sudden increase.  It is now part of the coalition agreement to increase the minimum wage to 1200 euros per month during the course of the government, and in all fairness this has been pushed by Pablo Iglesias of _Podemos_ (pictured) more than the PSOE.

The current increase was negotiated and agreed between government, unions and the employers organisation _CEOE_, so reduces the likelihood of business complaints about it later.  It remains to be seen whether such agreements will be easy to achieve in future years.
