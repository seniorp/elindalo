A recent visit to "Extranjer√≠a" (Immigration) showed that there nothing for the British immigrant to do at present to regularise their position.  The blue EU "tarjeta de residencia" residents card provided to us continues to be valid.

I was assured that this is so, that I have no need to renew it - nor even have it re-issued with my current address.  Immigration still have no knowledge of what will happen or when this will be announced, and in typical Spanish fashion told me "don't worry!"
