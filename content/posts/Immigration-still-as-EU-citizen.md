A recent visit to "Extranjer√≠a" (Immigration) showed that there nothing for the British immigrant to do at present to regularise their position.  The blue EU "tarjeta de residencia" residents card provided to the EU citizen continues to be valid.

I was assured that it remains valid, that I have no need to renew it nor even have it re-issued with my current address.  They have so far no knowledge of what will happen or when this will be announced, and in typical Spanish fashion, "don't worry!"
