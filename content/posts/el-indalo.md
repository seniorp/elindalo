_El Indalo_ comes from neolithic cave paintings discovered in Vélez-Rubio in the north of the province of Almería in the nineteenth century.  In the twentieth century it was adopted by a group of intellectuals and artists who became known as the Indalino movement.  This group was led by the painter Jésus de Perceval, who has a street in the capital named after him.  They saw their emblem as a little man holding up a rainbow, meant to symbolise a pact between man and the gods to avoid future floods.

A different interpretation has also been made.  It's no more than an archer taking aim at a bird passing overhead.  Take your choice.

In any case, it's now the symbol of the province of Almería and something of which the locals are rightly proud.

(If you want one, there's a kiosk outside the Gran Hotel Almería which sells everything from a necklace to a thimble branded with the lovely symbol!)
