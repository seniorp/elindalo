We come from Franco's rule and our laws carry many worrying vestiges of those dark times. If we look at the equivalents of comparative law in the more advanced European democracies, we will see that our supposed laws of rebellion and sedition have excessive penalties. In Europe, violence must be present for this last charge; and sentences, although varied, have an average range of 1 to 6 years.

So in 2018, the PSOE supported reform of the crime of rebellion â€” so that the EU did not continue to censure us and expose our shame, the fruit of a dictatorial regime that we did not really know how to get rid of - now is added, of course, to sedition.

So no, members of the Trio de Colon, stop the noise and accept this necessary modernising revision, the fruit of the unpleasant legacy of 40 years of dictatorship that we must banish from our legislation - and, if possible, from thought - in order to achieve a true democracy free from authoritarian blight.
