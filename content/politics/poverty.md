Philip Alston, UN rapporteur on poverty, has made a two-week visit to several autonomous communities and has seen a facet of society that is unknown amongst many people - that of extreme poverty.

In support of his claims, Alston quoted Eurostat data, according to which Spain is among the European countries with the highest percentage of poverty (26%), exceeded only by Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Italy.
There are several factors that have led Spain here and which have dragged the groups at risk of social exclusion into extreme poverty.

Among these factors is child poverty, which exceeds 30 per cent, and the housing crisis.  Little social housing exists and with the high price of rents many young people are left in situations they can't escape, and there are many tenants who can't pay their rent.

The case that struck most, among all the groups affected, is that of immigrants working in the countryside in Huelva (famous for its strawberry crops). When there is work they are called on immediately, but not offered even basic living conditions, such as housing or food. Wages are derisory, some earning as little as 30 euros for a day which often exceeds eight hours.

Alston has also highlighted how many gypsies live, building their own “shanty houses” in garbage dumps outside several cities, evictions, or people who have to choose between eating three times a day or just once to be able to turn on the heating.
