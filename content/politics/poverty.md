Philip Alston, UN rapporteur on poverty, has made a two-week visit to several autonomous communities and has seen a facet of society that is unknown amongst many people.

In support of these claims, Alston quoted Eurostat data, according to which Spain is among the European countries with the highest percentage of poverty (26%) exceeded only by Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Italy.
There are several factors that have led the country to this situation and have dragged the groups at risk of social exclusion into extreme poverty.

Among these factors is child poverty, which exceeds 30 per cent in Spain, and the housing crisis, which includes the little social housing that exists and the high price of rent, a fact that leaves many young people in situations they can't escape, and that many tenants can't pay their rent.

The case that struck most, among all the groups affected, is that of immigrants working in the countryside in Huelva. When there is work they are called on immediately, but not offered even basic living conditions, such as housing or food. Wages are derisory, some earning as little as 30 euros a day which often exceeds eight hours.

Alston has also highlighted how many gypsies live, building their own “shanty houses” in garbage dumps outside several cities, evictions or people who have to choose between eating three times a day or just once to be able to turn on the heating.
