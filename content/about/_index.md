I came to Spain in 2016.  I lived in Girona and later moved south via Malaga to Almeria.

In that time, the UK has voted for and practically implemented Brexit.

Corruption amongst politicians here has been rife.  Eventually this led to the fall of the People’s Party (Conservative) government led by Mariano Rajoy in 2018.

Meanwhile in Catalunya, the independence movement tried to unilaterally declare independence, leading to  many of its leaders either imprisoned or fleeing the country.

There was a long period of political instability, which has recently ended with the election of Spain’s first coalition government led by centre left President Pedro Sánchez.

The extreme right wing party Vox has come from nowhere to hold 52 seats in the national parliament, and the balance of power in various local governments, including here in Almería.  This happened largely because of the Catalan problem and the fear that Spain will start to break up.

The rise of Vox has brought together two distinctive left wing parties, the Socialist Workers (PSOE) and Podemos (“We can”) to form the coalition government.  They will now try to sort out the Catalan crisis, and bring in some progressive laws for the whole country after many months if not years without effective government.

Meanwhile I've been getting used to living here, finding my way round the city, the province and life as an immigrant, albeit a white one.
