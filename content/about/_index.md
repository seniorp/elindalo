I came to Spain in 2016.  I lived in Girona for a while then later moved south, living first in Malaga and later Almería.

Corruption amongst politicians was rife, almost every day some new scandal emerged on the telly.  In 2018 this led to the fall of the _Partido Popular_ (Conservative) government led by Mariano Rajoy.

Meanwhile in Catalunya, I saw the separatist republican movement try to unilaterally declare independence from the rest of Spain, leading to many of its leaders either imprisoned or fleeing the country.

There has been a long period of political instability, which has hopefully now ended, following the election of Spain’s first coalition government led by centre left President Pedro Sánchez.

The extreme right wing party _Vox_ has come from nowhere and now has 52 seats in the national parliament - and the balance of power in various local governments, including some in the province of Almería.  This happened largely because of the Catalan problem and the fear that Spain will start to break up.  Also on the _Vox_ agenda is immigration, women's and gay rights.

The rise of _Vox_ over the last year or two eventually forced together two distinctive left wing parties, the Socialist Workers (_PSOE_) and _Podemos_ (“We Can”) to form the coalition government.  They have to start to sort out the Catalan crisis (ignored by the right wing government of Rajoy), and bring in some progressive laws for the whole country after many months if not years without effective government.

Meanwhile I've been getting used to living in Almeria, finding my way round the city, the province and life as an immigrant, albeit a white one.  

I'm very excited to be living here at this time, and full of great expectations for the socialist government, especially at a time when I'm disillusioned by Brexit and the rest of it going on in Britain.  These are some of my thoughts, opinions and experiences around being an immigrant here at this time.
