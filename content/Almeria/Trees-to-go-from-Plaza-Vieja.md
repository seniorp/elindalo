A most unbelievable example of stupidity in public office here in Almer√≠a.  The renovation of the main square (which has been going on for about five years) is coming to a head.  The local council decided, following an architects report, to remove one hundred year old trees from the main square to improve the view of the town hall.

Bear in mind this is one of the hottest sunniest cities in Spain, with very little shade in the height of summer.  Not to mention the environmental crisis the world is facing.  There have been a number of public protests but all to no avail  The mayor knows best.

Pity the council are not as worried about the local government's free unofficial car park at the other side of the square (pictured), if they are so concerned about views in the Plaza.
