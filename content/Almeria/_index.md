Almería is a southern Spanish province which includes miles of unspoilt coastline, the only desert in Europe, fascinating and varied countryside and imposing mountain ranges.

Almería is also the name of a very special Spanish city.  Surrounded and cut off by mountains until the last decade, it has kept its character and charm.  On the original costa del sol, a name later usurped by the resorts west of Málaga, Almería enjoys over 300 sunny days a year.  

Yet tourism hasn't gone ballistic and changed the nature of the place as it has in many parts of the country. Almería remains affordable and recognisably Spanish, and enjoys a laid back quality of life difficult to find these days.
